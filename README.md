# SPC Control Chart Tool

A browser-based Statistical Process Control (SPC) tool built with Streamlit. Upload a CSV file, configure your analysis, and instantly generate control charts with full process capability reporting — no software installation required.

Supports X-bar/R, X-bar/S, and Individuals/Moving Range (I-MR) charts with automatic chart type selection, configurable spec limits, and one-click Excel export.

## Live App

**[https://spcanalysistool.streamlit.app](https://spcanalysistool.streamlit.app)**

Open in any browser — no Python, no Jupyter, no installation needed.

## Features

- **Three SPC chart types** — X-bar/R, X-bar/S, and I-MR; auto-selected based on subgroup size
- **Dual-panel chart** — X-bar (or Individuals) chart on top, R/S/MR companion chart below
- **Control limit zones** — green shading within control limits, yellow shading in warning zones
- **Capability indices** — Cp, Cpk (short-term) and Pp, Ppk (long-term) calculated automatically
- **Anderson-Darling normality test** — A² statistic + p-value banner; Cp/Cpk hidden when data is non-normal (only Pp/Ppk shown), since Cp/Cpk assume normal distribution
- **Process inferences** — automated 5-rule diagnostics (capability, centering, stability, ST-vs-LT consistency, normality) with bullet verdicts and narrative summary
- **Process statistics** — mean, short- and long-term sigma, min, max, and observation count
- **Configurable spec limits** — USL and LSL inputs with sensible defaults (mean ± 3σ)
- **Excel + PDF export** — formatted `.xlsx` report with embedded chart and data table; `.pdf` report with chart, stats, and inferences
- **Graceful error handling** — clear messages for malformed files, insufficient data, or invalid inputs

## How to Use

1. **Open the app** at [https://spcanalysistool.streamlit.app](https://spcanalysistool.streamlit.app)
2. **Upload a file** using the sidebar — supports CSV (comma, semicolon, or tab delimited) and Excel (`.xlsx` / `.xls`). For multi-sheet Excel files, a sheet selector appears automatically
3. **Select the column** to analyze from the dropdown (numeric columns only)
4. **Set subgroup size** using the slider — chart type auto-selects based on n
5. **Adjust USL and LSL** if the defaults (mean ± 3σ) do not match your specification
6. The chart and statistics update instantly — **Download Excel Report** to save results

## App Output

### Capability Indices

| Metric | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Cp** | Process capability — spread relative to tolerance (short-term sigma) |
| **Cpk** | Process capability accounting for mean centering (short-term sigma) |
| **Pp** | Process performance — spread relative to tolerance (long-term sigma) |
| **Ppk** | Process performance accounting for mean centering (long-term sigma) |

> **Note:** Cp/Cpk are hidden when the Anderson-Darling test reports non-normal data (p < 0.05), since these indices assume a normal distribution. Pp/Ppk remain shown.

### Normality Test (Anderson-Darling)

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **A²** | Anderson-Darling statistic |
| **p-value** | Stephens (1986) approximation; verdict at α = 0.05 |
| **Verdict** | NORMAL (p ≥ 0.05) → all capability indices shown; NON-NORMAL (p < 0.05) → only Pp/Ppk shown |

### Process Inferences

Five-rule diagnostic block printed below the metrics:

| Rule | Checks |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Capability | Cpk vs 1.33 / 1.0 thresholds |
| 2. Centering | Cp vs Cpk gap (off-center detection) |
| 3. Stability | Out-of-control points on the X-bar chart |
| 4. Drift | Cpk vs Ppk consistency |
| 5. Normality | Anderson-Darling verdict |

### Process Statistics

| Metric | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Mean (X̄)** | Grand mean of all subgroup averages |
| **Sigma ST** | Short-term sigma estimated from within-subgroup variation |
| **Sigma LT** | Long-term sigma — overall standard deviation of all individual values |
| **Min / Max** | Minimum and maximum values in the dataset |
| **Observations** | Total number of data points used in the analysis |

### Control Chart

- Top panel: X-bar (or Individuals) chart with UCL, LCL, USL, LSL, and a stats annotation box
- Bottom panel: R, S, or MR companion chart with its own UCL and LCL

### Excel Export

The downloaded `.xlsx` report contains two sheets:

| Sheet | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| **SPC Report** | Stats summary table (chart type, control limits, spec limits, capability indices) + embedded chart image |
| **Data** | Per-subgroup X-bar and R/S/MR values |

### PDF Export

The downloaded `.pdf` report contains a single A4 page with:

- Report title, column name, chart type, and date header
- Embedded control chart (X-bar + companion panel)
- Three-column stats table — Capability, Process, Control Limits
- Process Inferences section (5-rule bullets + narrative summary)

## SPC Methodology

- **Short-term sigma (Cp/Cpk)** is estimated from within-subgroup variation using R-bar/d₂ (X-bar/R) or S-bar/c₄ (X-bar/S) — this reflects the process's inherent capability when operating in a stable state.
- **Long-term sigma (Pp/Ppk)** is the overall standard deviation of all individual measurements — this reflects actual process performance including shifts and drifts over time.
- **Subgroup truncation** — data is truncated to the nearest complete subgroup; incomplete trailing observations are excluded.
- **SPC constants** (A2, A3, D3, D4, B3, B4, d2, c4) are tabulated for subgroup sizes n = 2 through 25 per AIAG/Shewhart reference tables.
- **Anderson-Darling normality** — uses `scipy.stats.anderson` with the Stephens (1986) small-sample correction (`A²* = A² · (1 + 0.75/n + 2.25/n²)`) and piecewise p-value approximation. Minimum sample size: 8. When p < 0.05, Cp/Cpk are suppressed since their normal-distribution assumption no longer holds.
